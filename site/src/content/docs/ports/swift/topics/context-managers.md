A tmux session, window, or pane normally remains until you kill it. Scope-based
cleanup can kill it when your code leaves a block, including after an exception.
See [Workspaces](/concepts/workspaces/) for a temporary layout example.

## Kill objects your program owns

Session, window, and pane values are non-owning. Call
`try await server.kill(session)` or the corresponding window or pane overload
when cleanup is required. Perform cleanup on both success and failure paths;
Swift's synchronous `defer` cannot await a tmux command.

## Testing cleanup

Use explicit cleanup for objects whose handles have no disposal hook. For an
entire disposable test server, prefer your port's test fixture or server guard;
see [Testing with libtmux](/guides/testing-with-libtmux/).
